*labels*:
Is the thing we're predicting, the y in the (x,y) variable in simple linear regression. the label could be the future price of
something or just any random thing

*Features*: 
 A feature is an input variable that we're using to train our y variable.
a simple ML project could use a single feature to millions or billions of features specified as
x1,x2,x3,x4,.....,xn

*labeled examples*:
A labeled example includes both label and feature(x)  {features, label}: (x, y)

*unlabeled examples*:
an unlabeled example contains features but not the label {features, ?}: (x, ?)


Use labeled examples to train the model. 
In our spam detector example, the labeled examples would be individual emails that users have explicitly marked as "spam" or "not spam."
Once we've trained our model with labeled examples, we use that model to predict the label on unlabeled examples

Models:
A model defined the relationship between a label and a feature.
Highlight of a model's life

*Training*:
Training means creating or learning the model. We do this by showing the model labeled examples (that both feature and labels)
to enable the model gradually learn the relationship betweenTHE Features and the label.

*Inference*:
Inference means applying the trainedmodel to unlabeled examples.
That is, us the trained modelto make predictions (y).
